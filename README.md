# canvas-green

## What is this?

The Admins just updated canvas and it looks bad. Here is how I found to fix it.

## What do I do?

Install [Stylus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en) for Google Chrome

## Then what?

Go to Canvas, click the extention tab, and click where it says sequoia.instructure.com

It will open up a file page. Paste the contents of main.css

Reload Canvas. Boom ur done.
